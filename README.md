# Diamond-Kinects
Solution to coding challenge

To solve the bonus question, the acceleration data is plotted as seen below

By eyeballing, an impact can be estimated to happen around index 760.
IMPROVEMENT: If this value was to be dynamically attained, then I would have found the derivative of the graph and highlighted the spot/index where the change starts to portray an increase pattern.
